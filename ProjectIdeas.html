							<h2>Project ideas</h2>
	
<p align="justify">A sharing app for overstocked purchased perishables and out of stock items in stores.</p>
	
<p align="justify">With the recent spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) there have been some great stories and messages of hope through people getting together to help one another within the community. One story that I feel can be transferred into an app is how a group of people have been sharing "out of stock products" through Facebook. This proposed app idea shows that I am passionate about the idea of fairness and that everyone has the right to have basic goods and services.</p>

<p align="justify">The concept of the app is to either share items - people could have the possibility to donate items, maybe to different categories of people, like elderly people, people in self isolation, health care workers and recently unemployed people.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Otherwise, if products are not put in a donated status, people could share items in an online bartering system where people could trade items where someone could trade "paper hand towels" for "soap" for example. Items that are traded would have to be negotiated through the app. When a person has requested to trade one item from someone else with one item from themselves, the app can send a message to the person so that they can respond quickly. This transaction could be accepted or declined through the app. If decline, the products are kept online so that other people can have the opportunity to barter or trade.</p>

<p align="justify">For products that are donated, these products can then be donated to people in need who are not able to go to the shops, weather they are in self isolation or cannot get to the shops themselves, or if they can get to the shops, people are still missing out on hard to get products.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Another positive aspect of this app is using a bartering system. This is relevant as we are now living in a world where a huge amount of the population does not have any work at the moment, trading or bartering for items may be a great alternative for people.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Another service which could help employ the recently unemployed is to offer a safe drop off service likened to that of uber eats or deliveroo as this may help alleviate the recent upsurge in online shopping trends. This service would be a paid service, so there could also be a pick-up service for products that people can pick up themselves.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Safety would be of high importance and items would have to have strict standards of unbroken packaging so that items could be cleaned and disinfected for the delivery drivers and people receiving items.</p>
	
<p align="justify">I think that this project is important at this time as it may help people in need to get out of stock products into their home safely and it may help people in need of work by offering driving opportunities.</p>
	
<p align="justify">It could assist in giving people the platform and the means to help each other in positive ways.</p>
	
<p>Making the app equitable.</p>

<p align="justify">As there may be people in the community that may want to take advantage of this app, to ensure the app is equitable and fair, people who join the app would have to provide details such as pension, disability or other relevant information that would help enable products to be donated or traded to people within the community who are more vulnerable.</p>
	
<p align="justify">If limitations are put into place from the stage of joining the app, then hopefully this will ensure people do not over barter or get too much products. As another precaution, the number of products that can be claimed could be capped.</p>

<p align="justify">This concept could have apps made for ios and android and should have a web-based service so that this could potentially be reached to as many people in the community as possible.</p>
	
<p align="justify">The app could have a similar interface like that of Facebook's "My Stuff, Your Stuff" where items are populated as a small image which can be clicked or tapped for further product details. The difference with this app is that once trade or share is complete, a delivery option with costs and time frame can be established within the app. A live map with delivery driver indication can be seen accessed through the app. People can leave note in a delivery instruction section where they can nominate safe drop off points either in their front yard or outside their front door (if people are not home).</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, there are similar websites such as free stuff and lots of Facebook selling pages but to have an app which concentrates on trading or bartering items along with delivery options may make this app have some unique.</p>
	
<p align="justify">I am not sure if this is an IT innovation as I am sure it is already being done, but I like the idea of combining exiting technologies to create something different and relevant for current conditions in society.</p>
	
<p align="justify">I assume that working in developing a project in creating an app may not directly be connected to having the skills for my ideal position, when looking at the bigger picture I would gain experience in working within a team, working with new software and existing hardware and be doing multiple problem solving tasks in the different stages of the project.</p>
	
<p align="justify">If the project is successful, people in the community may have a better chance of acquiring hard to get goods in the time of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p>
