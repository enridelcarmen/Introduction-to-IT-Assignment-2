							<h2> Interviews </h2>
				
							<h3> Interview 1 </h3>
				
							<p>Brooke - Senior Officer - Web Production and Publishing at Australian Maritime Safety Authority</p>
				
							<p>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</p>
				
							<ul>
								<li>User experience/User research in Government for the agency website</li>
								<li>Content upload to the website</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are these other IT professionals such as Clients? Investors? The general public?</p>
				
							<ul>
								<li>Mostly internal stakeholdersâ€”other staff for uploading content and conducting reviews of existing content. </li>
								<li>Otherwise liaising with our external vendor EY digital for web improvements.</li>
							</ul>
				
							<p>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</p>
				
							<p>Researching website issues and improvements that need to be made to our website. Using tools such as hotjar, google analytics and website feedback reports</p>
				
							<p>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</p>
				
							<p>Resolving website issues and bugs! Some are reoccurring and liaising with the vendor can be challenging when balancing the budget and project allocations for existing work.</p>
				
							<p>She also runs community of practice meetings within the agency each month which teaches best practice and shares insights and learnings among a select group of people from other teams within the organisation. Does a lot of liaison.</p>
				
							<h3>Interview 2</h3>
				
							<p>Nathan - Cyber Security Delivery Specialist - Technical Lead at Australian Maritime Safety Authority</p>
				
							<p>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? (Please include job title details)</p>
				
							<p>I am a consultant for a security and privacy company working on maturity and uplift for the education sector</p>
				
							<p>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</p>
				
							<p>Security and privacy</p>
				
							<p>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</p>
				
							<p>Due to delivery to a small amount of resources, I am on the tools.</p>
				
							<p>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</p>
				
							<ul>
								<li>Program management</li>
								<li>General managers</li>
								<li>Service owners</li>
								<li>Infrastructure support</li>
								<li>Web applications support</li>
							</ul>
				
							<p>Always fun trying to speak to their level. Most of the time I am required to develop implementation plans due to the limited skills and ownership of risks and issues.</p>
				
							<p>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</p>
				
							<p>People in process are good. But when dealing with 3rd party vendors at the time, they are not skilled enough they will shout loud and prey on clients selling mind games to stay relevant.</p>
				
							<p>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</p>
				
							<p>As a consultant you are brought in for a certain issue. Due to my personality I always try to ensure the whole 360 is covered</p>
				
							<p>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</p>
				
							<p>With out giving away the solution I am working on maturity and uplift.</p>
				
							<p>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</p>
				
							<p>An emotional service owner is always hard. They are always looking for what is in it it for them rather then efficiency or capability. If you find something in common eg rugby or music you have a chance of delivering a mutually beneficial solution</p>
				
							<p>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</p>
				
							<p>Implementing an effective solution to a limited resource pool that has perfected automation.</p>
