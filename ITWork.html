							<h3> Interview 1 </h3>
				
							<p>Brooke - Senior Officer - Web Production and Publishing at Australian Maritime Safety Authority</p>
				
							<p>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</p>
				
							<ul>
								<li>User experience/User research in Government for the agency website</li>
								<li>Content upload to the website</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are these other IT professionals such as Clients? Investors? The general public?</p>
				
							<ul>
								<li>Mostly internal stakeholdersâ€”other staff for uploading content and conducting reviews of existing content. </li>
								<li>Otherwise liaising with our external vendor EY digital for web improvements.</li>
							</ul>
				
							<p>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</p>
				
							<p>Researching website issues and improvements that need to be made to our website. Using tools such as hotjar, google analytics and website feedback reports</p>
				
							<p>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</p>
				
							<p>Resolving website issues and bugs! Some are reoccurring and liaising with the vendor can be challenging when balancing the budget and project allocations for existing work.</p>
				
							<p>She also runs community of practice meetings within the agency each month which teaches best practice and shares insights and learnings among a select group of people from other teams within the organisation. Does a lot of liaison.</p>
				
							<h3>Interview 2</h3>
				
							<p>Nathan - Cyber Security Delivery Specialist - Technical Lead at Australian Maritime Safety Authority</p>
				
							<p>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? (Please include job title details)</p>
				
							<p>I am a consultant for a security and privacy company working on maturity and uplift for the education sector</p>
				
							<p>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</p>
				
							<p>Security and privacy</p>
				
							<p>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</p>
				
							<p>Due to delivery to a small amount of resources, I am on the tools.</p>
				
							<p>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</p>
				
							<ul>
								<li>Program management</li>
								<li>General managers</li>
								<li>Service owners</li>
								<li>Infrastructure support</li>
								<li>Web applications support</li>
							</ul>
				
							<p>Always fun trying to speak to their level. Most of the time I am required to develop implementation plans due to the limited skills and ownership of risks and issues.</p>
				
							<p>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</p>
				
							<p>People in process are good. But when dealing with 3rd party vendors at the time, they are not skilled enough they will shout loud and prey on clients selling mind games to stay relevant.</p>
				
							<p>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</p>
				
							<p>As a consultant you are brought in for a certain issue. Due to my personality I always try to ensure the whole 360 is covered</p>
				
							<p>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</p>
				
							<p>With out giving away the solution I am working on maturity and uplift.</p>
				
							<p>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</p>
				
							<p>An emotional service owner is always hard. They are always looking for what is in it it for them rather then efficiency or capability. If you find something in common eg rugby or music you have a chance of delivering a mutually beneficial solution</p>
				
							<p>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</p>
				
							<p>Implementing an effective solution to a limited resource pool that has perfected automation.</p>

							<p>Jason Chan - IT Coordinator, Specialist Technical Support at UNSW</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>It's really good to see you again.</p>
				
							<p>Alright, OK so I'm just going to read off a script, but firstly I would like to thank Jason for accepting to carry out this interview and sparing the time. This is part of a group assignment, so it is not only me that is grateful, but my fellow team members are thankful for your time as well.</p>
				
							<p>Um, and today I would like to go to sorry I would like to interview Jason Chan. I met Jason when we were both working at Yellow Pages over 10 years ago. We were in different Department, so I was an advertising designer and Jason was in IT, actually Jason, what was your actual position title at Yellow Pages. I think that just caught us, a desktop support analyst back in those days. OK, yeah that that was the title. I just like to say I have to say that Jason was and still is a very friendly, helpful and approachable person. If I ever had a technical issue, he would go to resolve it quickly. Uh, when I send out a message to see if Jason was interested in doing this interview. I was extremely happy to get a reply of interest. So, thank you, Jason.</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>You're welcome.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>Uhm, I'm just going to talk about what you're currently doing, just so that everybody is watching, will know, and then I'll read out the questions and you can feel free to answer with any of those positions. Or you know, answer how you feel like anyway.</p>
				
							<p>OK, so you are currently work as an IT coordinator, Specialist Technical Support at University of New South Wales and you are a co-founder and co-designer at Subsonic Design Group and co-creator at Mental Images and co-founder, XR Advocate and Support Specialist for the Australian Edu XR (AR/VR/MR) Hub.</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>I am - it's a mouthful, and definitely.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>So yeah, you you've got a lot happening. Uhm, so the University of New South Wales is your full-time position - I'm guessing OK? And then you work when you have time to work on the other projects as well.</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>Well, that's huge. Alright so I'm going to get on with the questions now.</p>
				
							<p>So Question1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do and... yeah, you can talk about your different roles as well.</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>No problem, so, uh, I'll mainly talk about UNSW since that's the most uh in it related work. So, at UNSW I support the faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences is made of four schools, one is Arts and Media, Education is the other one, Humanities and Languages and Social Sciences. Amongst our faculty we also have a Research Centre for Post Grads, so I basically support the general side of day-to-day operations along with my colleagues in a team called Digital Support... uh, so it's basically break fix. If your computer doesn't work or some technologies not working, then that's when they contact us, and we help him fix it. However, in my role also fix a lot of specialized equipment, things such as we've got things like the music labs that have like keyboards and media equipment in etc. We've got a recording studio, animation as well. Ah, what else do we have? We've got quite a lot of specialized spaces. Um. podcasting spaces as well, so with those rooms, the colleagues of mine in digital support they look after general computers. You know things that just run software and not attached to any kind of hardware. So that's when we come in my team score specialist technology support. So, we look after anything that has an extra element to the computer. For example, as I mentioned, say the podcasting room has microphones, mixes and etc, so we need to be able to look after the extended equipment within that, uh, teaching space as well. Um, language labs, they have specialized software so general IT people would be able to fix things up, Microsoft Office, etc. but if there was a specialized software we call, say like Sanako, which is for language learning, they wouldn't unfortunately have the expertise and that's when we come in.
							So, the role is quite diverse. There's a lot of fun things you can do as I said. Uh, there's the School of Arts and Media, they have a lot of creative spaces there. Uhm, so basically in a nutshell we look after anything that's IT related or technology related... for the faculty. Uh, and that's also looking after meeting spaces and of course the Dean's unit, Uh, any professional staff or alumni.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>OK. Well, that covers. That's very diverse indeed.
							Alright, so um and then tell us about the, uh. I think this might have will tell us about the industry that you work in, so I think it might have already covered a little bit of that.</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>yeah, education in a nutshell.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>Thank you and so what other kind of work do you have to do? Which I think you've already talked about well.</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>It's, uh, it's a quite diverse role, so, um, I've been involved in even event coordination. Uh, well, because they know me as the virtual reality kind of advocate. I basically was given a role to invite other universities to come to our campus to participate in meetups and other opportunities such as that, where people can collaborate and meet up in network. So, I've done event coordination. What is have I done? Asset management. Unfortunately, with some redundancies over the last two/three years ago we lost our main admin person in the team and she used to handle the asset management and I was basically almost like an offsider like whenever she was away - I was her back up. So, when she left they kind of said "OK, you're looking after a bit of admin" so that's when asset management came along, um, into my role, as well as budgeting, because I'm involved heavily with the labs, meaning the refresh of the labs when equipment runs out warranty, we need to replace it, therefore we need to submit some kind of budget and well, who better to do it than the people who actually support equipment so they kind of hand forward that across as well. So, it's quite diverse - the role, you're doing a bit of admin, technical, bit of event management um, I'm just trying to think if there's anything else, uh, that's the main ones.
							Business development, yeah, we've invited you know, uh, software vendor and hardware vendors to the University and you know, help them get into the University but also, they offer us things like free licenses etc. because you know they're getting inroads with the students, so we kind of, I got to tee up those kind of events meetings as well. Development between UNSW and the different vendors externally, but that's pretty much it if we are talking about other types of a work I do within morale.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>Again, that's quite broad and there's a lot of diversity in that. That's really good!</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>Yes!</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>Uhm, and then so I, I suppose you pretty much talked about this as well. So, who are the people? The different people that you are interacting with at work. So that's like people within the University and then the other people, the software people, um administration, you have taken over that role, um is there anything you wanted to add with that? Or you pretty much feel like you're covered that?</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>You pretty much covered it, so I would say at the University record professional staff, so they would include people in school admins, their management staff, IT and of course academic staff. So that's all part of the professional staff that I deal with day-to-day... and external vendors, as you mentioned, and most importantly students of course. We do have a lot of visitors from other Universities, you know and not just visitors from other universities but parents of children, which we sometimes conduct workshops for children in school holidays. So, we deal with their parents as well as the students.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>Um and what about your interactions with other IT professionals so... you probably mentioned this as well before, so that is there anything else that you wanted to add that?</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>No - so generally speaking, on a day-to-day, we interact with the team called digital support, so digital support, basically, how do you call it? The front of house so they go out there to the customers and try and help them on the first level, and if there's any escalations then they'll come to us and say are we don't know this particular area, can you guys take over? Or we work collectively together, and we solve a problem.
							If there's a user needs a bit of us and a bit of them, we work together with that team, but they are usually the first point of call for any issues and then we step in if it needs escalations or anything else, so Digital Support - the Service Centre is quite important to us because they're the ones that take the calls so generally speaking, all issues and requests should go through the IT service Centre. Then they create tickets and basically, we pick it up or it gets assigned to us.
							Um, who else do we work with in IT? Engineering? Engineering basically creates what is called the SOE, the Standard Operating Environment, so we work closely with them as well, because we know what the different spaces require, that they're not...there's only a team of three, and if the university is humongous so the team is working with the local IT people in the different areas. So, we work with the engineers to ensure that the labs and other teaching spaces have all the right software and hardware to ensure we can teach effectively, efficiently, and besides that asset management, uh, they kind of they are part of IT,  there's a separate team that looks after assets for the entire University so we work closely with them as well?</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>OK. Um and then what aspects of your work do you spend most time on? and please tell us about them.</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>Oh, uh. Most time, uh, it would be properly consulting, to be honest. Troubleshooting and you know fixing issues is it's a large part of the job, but not as much as consulting. We get asked a lot about different software titles and platforms and how it can work for certain projects and tasks - so we do quite a lot of research. That takes a lot of our time and also very difficult issues. Things like if people are creating complex databases, they need advice. How can they, you know, perform a certain function to get a result at the end and so we got to do research about that as well. Just... and coordination basically, as well, because sometimes we don't have the answer, so we don't have the access in our team. So, we need to escalate to the correct teams to help resolve the issue of our customers. Maybe accessing certain folders and files on the server, to printer issues, etc. There is various things for various IT sections of the uni, so we basically coordinate that as well. </p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>OK, so which aspects of your work do you find challenging?</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>Oh, most challenging? Uh, itâ€™s when people require a certain amount of, say, computing power, needed software that we don't have budget for. There is quite a lot of budget constraints unfortunately within the universities. Um, and so we have to come up with very creative solutions and work arounds. But it is challenging because we know the solution is there, but we just financially cannot. Uh, afford to purchase it or lease it, etc and it's been. It's been, uh, uh, quite a hard problem to resolve. Because for example, if um staff members had a very old machine, say 8 year old computers, and they can't perform their day-to-day job, there's not much more we can do if they don't replace the machine, we can wipe it, reimage it, reload it, and it will still perform the same. Might be a small improvement, but overall and just basically needs to be replaced. So uhm, yeah. So that is, yeah, quite difficult having a budget constraint and also a limited time to resolve the problem. Yeah, it's something that we can't say. Oh, can you wait until next year? Will get a new budget and we can get your new computer because the lecture is in the centre needs to do what they do now, not later.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>Yeah, that sounds that would be really tricky. Uhm yes, alright so finally can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</p>
				
							<p>Jason</p>
				
							<p>Oh yes, the COVID-19 of course, the uh, so, uh, like everyone around the country and world we need now to basically work from home. So that was the biggest challenge for us and it really captured how important it was at that time, because many staff members at the University have desktop computers, so that's a huge problem because the management didn't want people to take the desktop computers from their offices, it's not manageable and hard to track. So, what they decide it was to get absolutely every staff member, a laptop, but um, a laptop with a monitor, of course, and a mouse and keyboard so you have the full desktop experience. But the problem with that is we had a very limited window to deliver all this and or allowed the staff members to collect or submit their requests so, uh, there was a major challenge, but we got through to it. We got it done and uhm, you know that really showed how important IT was because they really needed the IT support, not just to get the machines, but even after getting the machines then a lot of people were not familiar with different platforms like zoom and Microsoft Teams. There was a lot of new things that needed to be learned at a very quick pace, uh, and that's when we were able to, you know, hold the fort and get everyone up and running, and before you know, it will feel like we've been doing it for years and everyone's quite happy working at home and up and running with very minimal technical issues, and they had the support when they needed it.</p>
				
							<p>Matt</p>
				
							<p>That's good. So even though you have the small timeframe, you had the budget this time for to be able to do that. Now that's great. Yeah, well that's yeah that's amazing too. That's a good outcome to get in such a short time frame, so yeah. Yeah. Hum, well that's I think that's all my that's all my questions, you've been amazing answering all them in a lot of detail... it's been really good actually. Thank you, thank you for your time for this and I'll stop the recording and then I'll yeah, I'll say a cheerio, but yeah, thank you so much Jason for your time and yeah, that was amazing!</p>
