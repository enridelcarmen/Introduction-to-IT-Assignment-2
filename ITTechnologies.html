<h3> Enrique Del Carmen - Machine Learning </h>
<h4>What does it do?</h4>
<p align="justify">Machine learning is at the centre of the fourth digital revolution where the physical and digital world converge. According to IBM “machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that utilises algorithms to enable a system to learn from data rather than explicit programming” (IBM, 2020). It follows a process of data preparation, algorithm training and machine learning model generation then creation and refinement of its predictions. Prior to building the machine model the data must be analysed, formatted and conditioned, this is then used to train an algorithm for machine learning. The purpose of this algorithm is to use it as a set of instructions or procedures used to train on the data, this results in the creation of a machine learning model. Once the previous tasks have been completed, the model is able to form predictions or calculations on the data. For example, it is given a data set of images of animals and fruits to differentiate between the two entities. It will use its algorithms to sort and identify which images are animals or fruits. This process is completely free from human intervention. Furthermore, the more data is provided to the model and the longer it is trained for, the higher the chances of its accuracy.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">Machine learning is relatively based on a model of brain cell interaction (AI In Radiology, 2018). This idea was developed in 1949 by Donald Hebb in his book titled The Organisation of Behaviour which presents his theories on excitement and communication between neurons. In the 1950’s, Arthuer Samuel of IBM developed a computer program that was capable of playing checkers and popularised the term ‘machine learning’. Then in 1957, Frank Rosenblatt combined Donald Hebb’s and Arthuer Samuel’s knowledge to create the perceptron, the first neuro-computer, however, it was considered unsuccessful as it could not achieve its purpose to recognise visual patterns. The next significant development was in 1967 when Marcello Pelillio created the nearest neighbour algorithm which is considered to be the first proper basic pattern recognition which was utilized for mapping routes. The next significant instance of machine learning is when boosting was developed which was an algorithm to reduce bias in supervised learning and include ML algorithms to transform weak entities into strong ones (AI In Radiology, 2018). In 1997 a deep learning technique defined as the Long Short-Term memory laid to ground for modern speech recognition training. This technique involved the model that required events of memories that took place a thousand discrete steps earlier which is essential for speech. These are only some of the key events that shaped modern machine learning into what it is capable of today, and this technology is now an integral part of our society which has led to many developments of concepts and other technologies.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">In the current age, machine learning is capable of undertaking a multitude of tasks and is integrated into a wide range of industries. The retail sector uses machine learning to enhance customer experience by personalising interactions, optimise forecasting and supply chain planning (IBM, 2020). For example, Hubspot uses machine learning to provide marketers deeper insight into what search engines associate their content with, and uses this to allocate predictive lead scores to indicate sales teams which consumers are most likely to purchase their goods (Built In, 2020). The finance industry incorporates machine learning for a range of purposes including analysing data, uncovering investment options, predicting ability of customers to repay loans, customer service and help and detect fraud (IBM, 2020). Lemonade, an insurance company, uses machine learning in a unique way in contrast to other financial institutions. The business fully utilises machine learning and chatbots to handle services including managing insurance claims, obtaining quotes to streaming lining back-office administration (Algorithmxlab, 2020). Additionally, the organisation combines this technology with computer vision to capture existing geospatial imagery to create a proper information database (Algorithmxlab, 2020).
 </p>
 <p align="justify">Over the coming years, there will be a significant shift as machine learning will be increasingly integrated into our lives and alter the way tasks are done. One of the many possibilities for this technology is to implement it in robots. According to Alexandra Zelenka, a technical writer from DDI development, indicates that as machine learning advances, there will be increased usage of intelligent robots, however, this also requires advancements in other fields including artificial intelligence and deep learning. This development of intelligent robots will significantly impact our lives. From its usage to manufacturing in industries to assisting us with basic tasks at home, this would all be possible due to machine learning. Another possibility for machine learning in the recent future is the rise of quantum computing. According to Matt Reaney, founder and CEO of Big Cloud, quantum computing is going to revolutionise machine learning as it will enable faster processing, accelerated learning and increase its overall capabilities. This will allow current complex problems that could not be solved can be completed in a fraction of its time. Currently, there are no quantum computing algorithms, however, in the near future with the advancement of technology there is a possibility for this to occur as government agencies and research firms are investing millions to initiate quantum computing.
 </p>

<h4>What is the most likely impact?</h4>
<p align="justify">One of the most significant impacts of machine learning is for it to be used to improve robotics and lead to developments in artificial intelligence technologies. This will result in a dramatic shift in the composition and purpose of the workforce. A report conducted by PWC highlights the potential changes in the demand for workforce skills and how machine learning, automation and artificial intelligence are being implemented in the current workforce system. According to the report occupations involving technological skills will be highly sought as these systems will require highly skilled individuals and due to the increasing digitisation of jobs. Occupations requiring social and emotional skills are expected to increase as machine learning is still far from understanding or interpreting emotions, therefore, there will still be a need for workers in jobs involving these skills. Machine learning will cause a substantial shift in the need for basic cognitive skills to be lifted to higher ones. The decline for basic skills stems from the machines’ ability to automate tasks. As advanced computer algorithms are able to drastically reduce the time and manpower needed for these tasks. Occupations that require basic cognitive skills include cashiers, certain customer services and data entry jobs are expected to decline. The demand for physical and manual skills is expected to decline in the future. These jobs include drivers, assembly line workers, cleaners, food preparation. Certain declines in these skills vary depending on the automation machines. For example, machine learning would  have an easier time understanding assembly line work easier in contrast to assisting patients. Individuals that will be affected the most are those with a limited skill set that can be easily replaced by the use of machine learning. As its intelligence can be integrated in robotics or artificial intelligence to substitute human thinking and movement. The rise of machine learning will lead to a shift in the workforce as jobs that will be created, replaced or made redundant. As mentioned before occupations involving technological skills will increase leading to the creation of many new jobs in this sector. Occupations involving emotional and social skills will increase as machine learning is still unable to comprehend emotions at a reasonable level, meaning that these jobs will remain relevant in the future. Basic cognitive and physical and manual jobs will remain relevant, however, the demand for these occupations will decline as many of the tasks in this field are susceptible to automation. For example, some industries such as manufacturing, will see a change as certain workers can be replaced while others remain relevant. Although, we can only speculate the impact of machine learning, there is no doubt that it will have a significant impact in all areas of human work and endeavours.
 </p>
<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
<p align="justify">The use and development of machines learning  will lead to several fundamental transformations around the world as certain tasks and jobs can be replaced with the use of this technology. As stated previously in the report by PWC, as technological skills will be highly sought after in the future, a degree in a bachelor of IT will assist me to obtain an essential skill set for changes to come and one that will assist me in my future aspirations of a career in the IT or programming industry. At the moment I do not expect to notice a substantial difference in my daily life, as I believe that most of the work I do will not be significantly impacted by machine learning. However, one of the positive features of the impact of machine learning in industries, is that it will lead to the creation of new jobs and opportunities, which means I could find my future occupation in a job that does not currently exist yet or at least have increased chances of finding work. Although there may be significant differences for others, I do not believe there will be much difference with my life as machine learning will not really change much for me with my chosen profession. However, I believe that machine learning will affect my daily lives. For example, we may have certain machine learning influenced technologies such as  self-driving cars or certain robotics or software that can assist me with day to day work. The impact of machine learning will affect both family members and friends. Certain tasks that are done by friends who work part-time might change as they are replaced by machines or intelligence robots that are produced by machine learning. For example, physical and manual labour tasks  done by these friends could be replaced or assisted by robots or machines that are a product of machine learning. Family members will experience the impact in a similar way as certain tasks they used to do may be done or assisted by intelligent machines. Although I can only speculate on the impact of machine learning, there is no doubt that will cause a significant impact on all areas of human work and endeavours.

                    <h3>Benjamin Anh-Khoi Phan - Cyber Security</h3>
<h4>What does it do?</h4>
<p align="justify">Cyber security is the field that focuses on protection of everyone’s data and is continually trying to find better ways to keep data secure from cyber attacks. Currently, as of 2020, the latest technology for cyber security would be Blockchain, Cloud Technology, IoT(Internet of Things) Security, AI and Machine Learning, and Application Security. All of which are trends in the field as the latest means of data protection, whether it be through IoT software’s cybersecurity infrastructure or the rapid advancement of AI that helps professionals stay one step ahead of hackers. Keep in mind that this is only five trends as there are many other minor and major updates/trends that make up a new generation of cybersecurity, with many of them able to combine for more effectiveness.</p>
<p align="justify">Blockchain would serve as a new security function that allows companies to share information without worry. Cloud Technology has also upgraded their security to the point that previous complaints about it are considered obsolete, which is good since most companies nowadays use Cloud Technology as a way to store their customer and employee data. The Internet of Things used to be considered as easy targets for big profits considering how it connected devices without a security apparatus, which means hackers can infiltrate your network and steal your data from any easily accessible devices. Recently, however, big companies have taken notice of such issues and it is now considered common for IoT softwares to have a built-in cybersecurity infrastructure for IoT softwares. Not to mention AI and Machine Learning is now a big topic as machines and AI could replace typical security programs with a fully automated self-learning security guard that does not need frequent updates from Admins. The last would be Application Security, a simple function that should’ve already existed is now a fully functioning feature in most apps as it is now considered essential for apps to have security software built in during the app-building process.</p>
<p align="justify">Currently, it is possible for AI and computer software to detect scams and malware through learning patterns and immediately blocking them next time, not to mention how Blockchain is currently being tested to determine its security in sharing sensitive data and identity authentication in companies. The most likely thing to happen in the next 3 year would be the utilisation of fully automated and self-learning AI software that will be placed as the default security measure against data breaches. This means that any attempts of a breach of data, success or failure of the AI are automatically recorded into the system and the AI can learn from the pattern produced by that data to better itself. Basically, the more ways hackers try to retrieve data through illegal means, the more the AI learns how to block those attempts. Other technological developments that would help in this would be Cloud Technology that allows the system to easily categorise attempts and allow for administrators to edit or update with ease. Aside from Cloud Technology, other trends mentioned like Blockchain could also serve as additional security as a way for the AI to thwart hacking attempts. This means that the AI can utilise the latest security measure without having to be manually updated every time a single improvement is needed and there would be no need to teach new employees on how to use new software. Aside from that, AI can also be programmed to adapt to new security measures like the new IoT cybersecurity infrastructure or Application Security that is updated every year. This is not to mention the numerous ways hackers can exploit new security before it can be considered as proper security.</p>

<h4>What is the most likely impact?</h4>
<p align="justify">The potential impact of the new cybersecurity would just mean more secure protection for everyone’s data. However, this also means that your data might have to be viewed by security companies as mean to further secure your data. Most likely, data collected will need to be thoroughly reviewed by the AI or new security measures as a check for viruses and malware.</p>
<p align="justify">The people that these new trends would likely affect would be organisations, however, it also applies to everyone else as consumers use services every day, which means they do interact with these changes indirectly, even more so when nowadays most people have transitioned onto the Cloud, storing most of their data as backup. Blockchain and Application Security would be two trends that directly affect companies and their consumers, as Blockchain would provide even more secure protection for users’ data with Application Security acting as the initial security test before being tested by Blockchain in the company’s database.</p>
<p align="justify">AI, first and foremost, would replace the need for staff manning security on their database with only one or two on the scene in case of emergencies. However, other trends listed would not replace or make any jobs redundant as they are only tools for employees to utilise and enjoy the protection of rather than a replacement for their work. Not to mention these are only in their beginning phase and are still being tested regularly against malwares and viruses for improvements so it would be a long while before they can genuinely act as a trustworthy gate for data and therefore would lessen the employee needed, not entirely replaced. Furthermore, cybersecurity, in the end, is still a human job as machines can not deviate from its programming, as even AI will hit a wall and take a while to resolve a problem.</p>

<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
<p align="justify">In truth, this wouldn’t affect the way I work or go about in my daily life. These trends are just additional security measures, which benefits me, so I wouldn’t really mind it having to check through my data. Not to mention they are still being tested so full implementation of said trends is still far off. Things like AI and how it can replace the default security is still a big speculation on my part based on the evidence I gathered so I wouldn’t count on it being a problem just yet.</p>
<p align="justify">As for my family and friends, they would also be of the same opinion, if not slightly wary of having their stuff checked. Most of my family is ignorant of the technicalities of IT so they truly wouldn’t care as long as it does its job while my friends would be more inclined to do more research before they use it. However, as mentioned, as long as we are all consumers, we would indirectly use these apps or maybe even directly, even if we aren’t aware of what it is. Blockchain and Application Security, or even the IoT, are just a few examples of what we would use every day so any extra security would just be a plus for us.</p>
<p align="justify">Since it doesn’t affect me in any way, I can only speculate on their effectiveness and transparency. Checking through our data would make anyone anxious so it’s important for the security company and organisations using these technologies to make a disclaimer for users, in addition to admitting any drawbacks or flaws it’s experiencing. I personally use the Cloud to upload my data as backup so I need to know if I can trust a security feature and if it can really protect my information. In the end though, it all just boils down to extra and improved security so it really doesn’t affect me, my family or friends in any way.</p>


<h3> Timmy Nguyen Dang - The Internet Of Things </h3>
<h4> What does it do?</h4>
<p align="justify"> The internet of things refers to a set of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines that each have their own UIDs. These devices and machines can transfer data through a network without human to human or human to computer interaction. Essentially, this internet of things is network in which physical devices and machines are connected by, allowing them to transfer and collect data, this network is called the internet. The internet of things allows for devices to communicate with each other without the need of a physical human being. The state of the art of this type of technology would include something as little as a lightbulb, where people are able to purchase a smart light, which would then be connected to ones network/internet, where a smartphone or computer system connected to such network has the ability to control this lightbulb. This is an example of technology within IoT, as lightbulbs in the modern day would be connected by a wire, in which a switch would control the bulb, whereas with the new lightbulbs, they are controlled by smartphone devices. This refers to the IoT, as it shows that a physical object (lightbulb) can be connected to the internet, where it could be controlled or be used to communicate information. Currently the internet of things extends as far as a child’s toy to a driverless vehicle, where larger devices include thousands of sensors, allowing them to constantly transfer data throughout the network, thus making sure the object functions well. According to many online sources, the internet of things holds limitless potential, as technology grows overtime, with people constantly relying on technology throughout their daily lives, the industrial internet will constantly grow, expanding the potential of everyday objects to be connected through a network and being controlled by a smartphone, by transferring data. Many different devices are connected to the internet, in 2016, 4.7 billion devices are connected to the internet and in 2021, the estimated number of devices is around 11.6 billion IoT devices. The future for IoT is limitless, as technology advances, many different devices are released, all connecting to the internet as a network, with billions and billions of devices to increase this number, the further technology advances. </p>
<h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
<p align="justify">Overtime, the internet of things will expand, growing to include billions upon billions of devices to be connected to the network. It is said, that the internet of things holds limitless potential, where the advancement in technology will determine the different physical objects that can transmit data within the internet. The potential impact within the development of IoT would affect many cities and companies, as many will adapt within the technological world, where they would take advantage of this technology in order to save money and time. Many people will be affected by the advancement of technology and the internet of things, as everyone’s everyday objects will eventually be connected through the internet, with examples already showing how something as simple as a light, can be controlled by a smartphone or any smart device within the household that is connected to its network. This will not necessarily negatively affect people, as it allows for a more remote way of controlling everyday devices, as technology further allows for physical objects to transmit data through the networks. However, many can also see this advancement in a negative way, as this could allow individuals to become lazier through the remote controlling of objects, such as lightbulbs, cars, thermostats, etc. As users could control such objects through their smartphone and not having to physically contact such devices/objects.  </p>
<h4>How will this affect you? </h4>
<p align="justify">In my daily life, the internet of things wont affect me as much as others, as I don’t see the purpose of spending money on replacing physical objects that are working perfectly fine throughout my everyday life in order for them to have the ability to connect to the internet. However, in the future if I were to replace such objects, I would take into consideration how I could remotely control these objects through the network. Currently throughout my everyday life, I own a small number of physical objects that are connected through the internet, with my smartphone allowing me to control such objects, such as LED lights (nano leaf) and my desktop. Overall, the internet of things does not significantly affect me, although it makes controlling minor lights in my room much easier, allowing me to control the LEDs through my smartphone, without having to physically turn it on and off through a switch. Nothing will significantly change for me, as the IoT develops, other than making it much easier to control physical objects through smartphones. As for family, the internet of things has already made my brother’s life much easier, through smart lights, as he had already installed light bulbs in which he is able to control from using his smartphone. The effect that IoT would have on other family members and friends would be unknown, as I am unaware of their views on having their physical objects being controlled by their smartphones and devices through the internet. Many friends have spoken about having these smart objects implemented in their everyday lives, however, have never found the need to replace the basic version of these objects, seeing it as a “waste of money”. </p>


<h3> Russell Lam - Data Science
<h4> What does it do?</h4>
<p align="justify"> Data defines as information-based set on variables that are qualitative and quantitative about people or items. A data scientist in this field focuses on these sets of data and through scientific experimentation (methods e.g. algorithms or test) in which then extracts and collects new knowledge. With their expertise in technology and social science data scientists are now are heavily dependent in our current businesses as for a data scientist uses their skill and abilities to develop an actionable plan and direction for the business or companies to take. This is through a rigorous process in which they gather the data, thoroughly clean the data (e.g. cleaning for mistakes, inconsistent datatypes or missing value or attributes) then transforms this data based on define mapping tool, after this step a data scientist must explore and analyse the data to make it fully define and refine (e.g. Talend or Informatica), furthermore based on the previous step the data scientist uses this data to model in which they use their diverse learning techniques to choose the correct data model for the business and to further continue the data scientist tests out their model on a small scale either through the community or through the company and lastly the data scientist communicates this to the business with their findings and reasons. Programs such as Java, Apache Spark, Excel, etc. these programs require high skills to be used well such as being able to know R programming, Python coding, SQL database coding, etc.
A job of a data scientist is a time-consuming process in which the practice could take up to anywhere from 10 days to 10 years depends on the type of project and the amount of data require. This type of science  is currently not as optimal as it could be improved a lot such as the efficiency of the process this could be a development of new technology that could cite data faster and quicker in which this could minimise the time duration, or perhaps a new coding language or programs that could make modelling data easier.
</p>

<h4> What is the likely impact?</h4>
<p align="justify">As stated, before data science is heavily dependent on in business and companies, in which it could be the determining factor for a business to fail or succeed in their field. This is due to the knowledge and information a data science provides to the business as such one main role of a data science is mitigate risk and fraud as they specialise in analysing data source using their method and process, now if data scientist wasn’t around there would be a higher chance off risk as the business wouldn’t have the amount of resource or time require to thoroughly research each data and refine it as it requires high skill and levels of training and experience in the field. In addition to this data science provides a insight knowledge in people as such their job is to understand how data is interacted through the environment in which this provides organisations a in depth insight to what they should be selling or advertising and when is the right time, without a data scientist in this case could lead products to be wasted and non-profitable in which would be very negative for the business. Furthermore, with data science being applied in almost all business people would become affected either if its minimal or a lot as data science has a connection in most interactions we people have in society, as for example are logistics companies (e.g. DHL, FedEx or AusPost) in which data science provides them ways to discover a faster time route for shipment or another example is targeted direct marketing to individuals such as by using data the business directs products to interested people or future customers.
Data science is a growing job in many countries as such a high percentage of growth is being shown I the current modern day, the job of a data scientist would not make any job redundant in any aspects as it would just be their to provide business with a new asset and would not replace any other individuals job.
</p>

<h4> How will this affect you?</h4>
<p align="justify">Data science as particularly affected me as an individuals in ways such as personalised products or services from websites online such as from using my personalised data, websites are able to direct their targeted products to me as the customer in addition to the websites tend to my needs such as customisation and settings being implemented to set a better mood for me as a customer and by doing this engages and persuades me to be a returning customer. An example of this is online shopping websites (e.g. Amazon, Nike, Adidas) in which when I use these sites, ads begin to appear around for similar products I was viewing thus displaying the use of personalised data being used to target me. This process is different to all user as each user is unique and have different data sets, user would be targeted separately and different as business will try to engage them in ways they will perceive as alluring and beneficial for them. As for example is my family or friend’s data would be completely different as for them their hobbies and interest are separate and would not be as similar to one another. </p>

							<h4>What does it do?</h4>
							<p align="justify">Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
		  					<p align="justify">Cloud computing has evolved from larger companies such as salesforce.com and Amazon.com developing online infrastructure as their own companies grew and evolved. Salesforce.com gave enterprises the opportunity to have customisable online applications at a cheaper price. Amazon.com grew from selling books to electronics, furniture and electrical. With this growth, Amazon realised there was an oversupply of IT infrastructure that could be rented to small/medium IT businesses. The initial services were Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Other companies developed similar services such as Google App Engine and Microsoft Azure.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>
		  					<p align="justify">Cloud computing provides online servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence  (Microsoft Azure, What is cloud computing? n.d) which is paid by consumers and enterprises. What makes cloud computing so unique is that the online services are instantly accessible, are much cheaper and more customisable. The downside of cloud computing is that there are security issues and data may not be completely deleted. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>
		  
		  					<p align="justify">"Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless, and software as a service (SaaS). These are sometimes called the cloud computing "stack" because they build on top of one another."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>
	
							<p align="justify"><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong> is the most basic category of cloud computing services. Users or enterprises rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.<br>
							<strong>Platform as a service (PaaS)</strong> supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.<br>
							<strong>Serverless computing overlaps with PaaS</strong>, focusing on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.<br>
							<strong>Software as a service (SaaS)</strong> is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>
								
							<p align="justify"><strong>Cloud computing architecture</strong> refers to the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front-end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile device), back end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network (Internet, Intranet, Intercloud). Combined, these components make up cloud computing architecture. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>
								
							<p align="justify"> "Cloud deployment refers to the enablement of SaaS (software as a service), PaaS (platform as a service) or IaaS (infrastructure as a service) solutions that may be accessed on demand by end users or consumers. A cloud deployment model refers to the type of cloud computing architecture a cloud solution will be implemented on. Cloud deployment includes all of the required installation and configuration steps that must be implemented before user provisioning can occur." <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></p>
		  
		  					<p align="justify"> "There are four types of them: public, private, hybrid and community clouds. Additionally, there are also distributed clouds, multiclouds, poly clouds and other models, but they are not so widespread." <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>
		  
		  					<p align="justify"> Public clouds are available to the general public. Data is created and stored on third-party servers. Public clouds are good for users who are not concerned about security. Public clouds are easier to use and maintain and is easily scalable i.e. increase services as a company grows. Public clouds are a cheaper option for smaller businesses, paying for the services that you use and not having to invest in hardware or software. These services are generally available 24/7. The disadvantages of a Public cloud is that they can experience malfunctions or outages and they have security issues as the data storage location may not be known. Serves are generic and not tailored to the user or enterprise.<br>
							Private cloud is very similar to a public cloud yet only one company owns and has access to a Private cloud, regardless of its location being on or off site. Private clouds are more secure, customisable and reliable. The major drawback of a private cloud is that it is more costly.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></p>
		  
		  					<p align="justify"> Community cloud is similar to a private cloud but has multiple companies with similar backgrounds sharing the infrastructure and related resources. It is suited to multiple companies that work together and share information; hence data sharing and collaboration is easier. The cost is shared between the different companies and Community cloud has good security, privacy and reliability. It is an expensive option when compared to the Public cloud and multiple companies have to share storage and bandwidth capacity.<br>
							Hybrid cloud uses the best features of Public, Private and Community. A company can place sensitive data on a Private Cloud and use a Public cloud for less sensitive information. The benefits of a Hybrid cloud are improved security and privacy, enhanced scalability and flexibility and a reasonable price but it is only works for companies that can separate data into sensitive and non-sensitive. <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></p>
