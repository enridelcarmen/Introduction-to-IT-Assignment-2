                    <h3>Benjamin Anh-Khoi Phan - Cyber Security</h3>
<h4>What does it do?</h4>
<p>Cyber security is the field that focuses on protection of everyone’s data and is continually trying to find better ways to keep data secure from cyber attacks. Currently, as of 2020, the latest technology for cyber security would be Blockchain, Cloud Technology, IoT(Internet of Things) Security, AI and Machine Learning, and Application Security. All of which are trends in the field as the latest means of data protection, whether it be through IoT software’s cybersecurity infrastructure or the rapid advancement of AI that helps professionals stay one step ahead of hackers. Keep in mind that this is only five trends as there are many other minor and major updates/trends that make up a new generation of cybersecurity, with many of them able to combine for more effectiveness.</p>
<p>Blockchain would serve as a new security function that allows companies to share information without worry. Cloud Technology has also upgraded their security to the point that previous complaints about it are considered obsolete, which is good since most companies nowadays use Cloud Technology as a way to store their customer and employee data. The Internet of Things used to be considered as easy targets for big profits considering how it connected devices without a security apparatus, which means hackers can infiltrate your network and steal your data from any easily accessible devices. Recently, however, big companies have taken notice of such issues and it is now considered common for IoT softwares to have a built-in cybersecurity infrastructure for IoT softwares. Not to mention AI and Machine Learning is now a big topic as machines and AI could replace typical security programs with a fully automated self-learning security guard that does not need frequent updates from Admins. The last would be Application Security, a simple function that should’ve already existed is now a fully functioning feature in most apps as it is now considered essential for apps to have security software built in during the app-building process.</p>
<p>Currently, it is possible for AI and computer software to detect scams and malware through learning patterns and immediately blocking them next time, not to mention how Blockchain is currently being tested to determine its security in sharing sensitive data and identity authentication in companies. The most likely thing to happen in the next 3 year would be the utilisation of fully automated and self-learning AI software that will be placed as the default security measure against data breaches. This means that any attempts of a breach of data, success or failure of the AI are automatically recorded into the system and the AI can learn from the pattern produced by that data to better itself. Basically, the more ways hackers try to retrieve data through illegal means, the more the AI learns how to block those attempts. Other technological developments that would help in this would be Cloud Technology that allows the system to easily categorise attempts and allow for administrators to edit or update with ease. Aside from Cloud Technology, other trends mentioned like Blockchain could also serve as additional security as a way for the AI to thwart hacking attempts. This means that the AI can utilise the latest security measure without having to be manually updated every time a single improvement is needed and there would be no need to teach new employees on how to use new software. Aside from that, AI can also be programmed to adapt to new security measures like the new IoT cybersecurity infrastructure or Application Security that is updated every year. This is not to mention the numerous ways hackers can exploit new security before it can be considered as proper security.</p>

<h4>What is the most likely impact?</h4>
<p>The potential impact of the new cybersecurity would just mean more secure protection for everyone’s data. However, this also means that your data might have to be viewed by security companies as mean to further secure your data. Most likely, data collected will need to be thoroughly reviewed by the AI or new security measures as a check for viruses and malware.</p>
<p>The people that these new trends would likely affect would be organisations, however, it also applies to everyone else as consumers use services every day, which means they do interact with these changes indirectly, even more so when nowadays most people have transitioned onto the Cloud, storing most of their data as backup. Blockchain and Application Security would be two trends that directly affect companies and their consumers, as Blockchain would provide even more secure protection for users’ data with Application Security acting as the initial security test before being tested by Blockchain in the company’s database.</p>
<p>AI, first and foremost, would replace the need for staff manning security on their database with only one or two on the scene in case of emergencies. However, other trends listed would not replace or make any jobs redundant as they are only tools for employees to utilise and enjoy the protection of rather than a replacement for their work. Not to mention these are only in their beginning phase and are still being tested regularly against malwares and viruses for improvements so it would be a long while before they can genuinely act as a trustworthy gate for data and therefore would lessen the employee needed, not entirely replaced. Furthermore, cybersecurity, in the end, is still a human job as machines can not deviate from its programming, as even AI will hit a wall and take a while to resolve a problem.</p>

<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
<p>In truth, this wouldn’t affect the way I work or go about in my daily life. These trends are just additional security measures, which benefits me, so I wouldn’t really mind it having to check through my data. Not to mention they are still being tested so full implementation of said trends is still far off. Things like AI and how it can replace the default security is still a big speculation on my part based on the evidence I gathered so I wouldn’t count on it being a problem just yet.</p>
<p>As for my family and friends, they would also be of the same opinion, if not slightly wary of having their stuff checked. Most of my family is ignorant of the technicalities of IT so they truly wouldn’t care as long as it does its job while my friends would be more inclined to do more research before they use it. However, as mentioned, as long as we are all consumers, we would indirectly use these apps or maybe even directly, even if we aren’t aware of what it is. Blockchain and Application Security, or even the IoT, are just a few examples of what we would use every day so any extra security would just be a plus for us.</p>
<p>Since it doesn’t affect me in any way, I can only speculate on their effectiveness and transparency. Checking through our data would make anyone anxious so it’s important for the security company and organisations using these technologies to make a disclaimer for users, in addition to admitting any drawbacks or flaws it’s experiencing. I personally use the Cloud to upload my data as backup so I need to know if I can trust a security feature and if it can really protect my information. In the end though, it all just boils down to extra and improved security so it really doesn’t affect me, my family or friends in any way.</p>
