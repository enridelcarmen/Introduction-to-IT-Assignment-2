							<p>I enjoy using computers in my day to day life, and I have seen how both technology and Information Technology have developed over the past 20 years and it is exciting. I would like to be a part of the further developments in this technology and I would like to see if I can have a better understanding of "how things work".</p>
							<h2> Ideal Job </h2>
							<p>I found the job of IT Support Engineer. I fundamentally love using computers, testing things out, installing new software and reinstalling operating systems, so I feel I can put this job into "my ideal job" category. These interests are good foundations of the other attributes that are required in the job.</p>
							<p>I could do this on a day to day basis</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Review, deploy and test new hardware and devices for end users
								</li>
								<li>Do daily backups</li>
								<li>Customer service and support</li>
								<li>Monitor and troubleshoot network performance</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The skills and experience needed for this job are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Proved experience as an ICT Support Engineer of Desktop Support Engineer</li>
								<li>Well versed in ITIL</li>

								<li>Service Now ticketing system</li>
								<li>General desktop, hardware and device management support</li>

								<li>Experience with MDM - Citrix XenMobile, HP Storage and backup, Tape Drive support (HP Data Protector), Veeam, VMware, vSphere, Symantec Enterprise Vault, General VOiP support (Mitel and/or Polycom)</li>
								<li>The skills that I currently have for this position are good knowledge of Operating Systems and software applications (but probably not specific applications), excellent interpersonal skills and good written and verbal communication skills.</li>
								<li>To gain the skills for this position, my plan is to obtain my Bachelor of Information Technology degree from RMIT and to get a relevant internship to get direct hands on experience as a Desktop Support Engineer or Support Technician. Both of these will increase my knowledge of operating systems, software applications and remote connection systems. Additionally, I will gain experience in solving complex hardware and software issues. In the next three years I will have significantly increase my skills and knowledge in these areas. I feel that as I continue my studies and become more knowledgeable in the different areas of Information Technology, my ideas of an ideal job may change dramatically.</li>

							<h2>Basic Information</h2>
                                                        <ul>
                                                        <li>I was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia in 2011 in hopes of a better education.</li>
                                                        <li>I've completed the basic education, which means I graduated Year 12, before now studying in RMIT university.</li>
                                                        <li>Aside from the above information, I speak 2 languages somewhat fluently; Vietnamese and English, with the latter being my second language. I also have some education in Japanese but well, let's just say I wasn't exactly top student material.</li>
                                                        <li>My hobbies include playing video games, watching anime and listening to music(mostly Japanese).</li>
                                                        </ul>
							<h2> Ideal Job </h2>
							<p>I've got three companies that are basically my dream job to work for any of them; Blizzard, RiotGames and Valve.</p>
			                                <p>Unfortunately, none of the companies has any open positions in Australia but I also don't mind having to move overseas for the work.</p>
						        <p>All of the jobs have some harsh requirements but well, it's a dream job that I have to work towards as my goal so it's expected. I'll talk in detail about Valve since that's my most preferred place to work at.</p>
					<h3>What about this job appeals to you?</h3>
				<p>Well, it's obviously the fact that the company is at the top of the industry as a well-respected name. Not only do they have the latest software and hardware there, the work that they do are both innovative and industry-changing. Additionally, the workplace according to a lot of former and current employees are very pleasant to work at and has satisfactory work confiditons.</p>
					<h3>What skill requirements does this job have?</h3>
				<p>It's listed on the website but I'll summarise it here; Strong grasp of C++, 4+ years of profressional software development experience, strong software engineering skills, good communication and teamwork skills and finally, the ability to finish work independently.</p>
					<h3>What are the skills that you currently have compared to the requirements?</h3>
				<p> It's listed above. Though the short answer would be a hilariously depressing nothing, since I am a total newbie so the job is still quite far off in the future.</p>
					<h3>What's your plan on getting this job?</h3>
				<p> I still haven't graduated university yet so obviously that first... While I still don't have any concrete plans, or any for that matter, the general direction would probably be working for any IT-related company and steadily transition towards the gaming industry while gaining the needed experience and required skills to get the job. That's basically it for now, since I kind of need to learn the basics before thinking any further.</p>
							<h2> Personality Profile </h2>
							<p>"INFPs never seem to lose their sense of wonder. One might say they see life through rose-colored glasses. It's as though they live at the edge of a looking-glass world where mundane objects come to life, where flora and fauna take on near-human qualities. INFPs have the ability to see good in almost anyone or anything. Even for the most unlovable the INFP is wont to have pity."</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Introvert</li>
								<li>Intuitive</li>
								<li>Feeling</li>
								<li>Perceiving</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
							<p>Your Key Motivators:</p>
								<li>Listening to and helping others</li>
								<li>Spending time alone to regroup</li>
								<li>Contemplating philosophical or complex challenges</li>
								<li>Creatively solving complicated problems</li>
                                                                <li>Following flexible schedules that allow room for change</li>
							</ul>

                                                        <h3>Auditory</h3>
<p>"They indicate emotion through the tone, pitch, and volume of their voices. They enjoy listening but cannot wait to get a chance to talk. They tend toward long and repetitive descriptions. They like hearing themselves and others talk."</p>
